# Simple budgeting database

python code for starting and operating a budgeting database:

planned functionality: 

add payment
add person to track-list

print payments - sorted/filtered by: date, tracked persons, amount spent, categories

print total spending  -filtered: by user / by category / by both

print list of users who exceeded their total spending limit



After i finish working on the code i will contenerise it, composing it togather with an SQL server so its ready to run on any docker system.
possible GUI implementation if i feel like sharing it or smth.
